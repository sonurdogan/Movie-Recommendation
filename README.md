In this work, I will discuss the application of Matrix Factorization technique with ALS optimization algorithm on the Collaborative Filtering-based recommendation system. I will cover the model [1] which is developed, used in the Netflix competition [2] and won Netflix Prize in this paper. I will be focusing application of the model to the movieLens [3] data, which consist of ratings of movies by different users with Spark [4], which is Large-scale data analytics engine with a unified engine.
